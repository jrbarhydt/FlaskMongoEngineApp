# FlaskMongoEngineApp
Flask API using mongo-engine to serve mongodb with restaurant data


Note: The MongoDB sample data used is pulled from https://github.com/scottsimpson/restaurant-database, 
which was published by Scott Simpson for LinkedIn Learning.

To fill your db with data, modify MongoEngineDB/Scripts/LoadData.py to include your mongo database name, then run the script.
